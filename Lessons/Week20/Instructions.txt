Lesson Plan

We will be continuing our discussion about Projectile motion and more complex motion in general.
Remember that Desmos is very useful https://www.desmos.com/calculator

1) Quick review of last class where I introduced the idea that equations can be used to determine
   how an object moves

2) Lets just take a step back and program some equations (this is very easy)

3) Alright back to making things move!
   - Lets me introduce you to the equations for projectile motion
   - Ok using these equation(s) can we model a ball flying through the air?
   - What about a ball dropping vertically?

4) What other types of equations can we use? 
   How can we make something move in a circle? 
   What about a wave?

5) Ok back to circles... we can think of circles in polar coordinates


Note: we can flip axis by doing
def draw():
    scale(1, -1)
    translate(0, -900)
