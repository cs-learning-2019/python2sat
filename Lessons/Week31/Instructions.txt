We will have a quick lesson on reading and writing text files

Introduce the final project
Final Project Rules
1) You are allowed to look things up to help you but the end product must be your own
2) If you copy any code you first must fully understand it
3) You have until the end of the term to finish
4) Ideas are up to you but you must inform me of your idea so I can approve of it
5) You must use Python and Processing
6) You are free to talk to me and get help on coding anytime during class
7) No you do not need to use classes, but I highly recommend it. In Python CCC you will have to use classes.

Sample Ideas that you are free to use (these ideas are what I consider reasonable for your skill level)
1) Space Invaders [video game]
2) Frogger [video game]
3) Python Video Filter [You will need to do some research on OpenCV --- This idea is a bit harder]
4) Photo Show [A program that present a bunch of photos in a slide show format]
