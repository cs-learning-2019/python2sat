Begin talking about the first major project and the concepts required to complete the assignment

1) We will do VERY simple object detection using sum of pixel differences
2) We can dicuss the other method such as Normalized dot product
3) We can do finding waldo
4) We can talk about Neural networks if we have time just for fun
