We will now start our final project for the term.
This project will have a less serious feel compared to the last project which was face detection.
Our final project will be an interactive screen saver similar to the one with bubbles in the Windows OS.

Here is what our project needs.
1) Bubbles will spawn onto the screen. Each time you press UP arrow a new bubble spawns. A bubble gets popped when you press DOWN arrow.
     - When a bubble spawns it will have a random color, radius, direction and speed (what is the relationship between direction and speed???)
     - Bubbles need to be somewhat transparent
     - We will need multiple arrays to store all the required data for the bubbles

2) The bubbles will need to bounce off the four walls.
     - A simple way to do this is just to loop through all the bubbles and modify the directions accordingly
     - Bubbles do not need to bounce away from each other (unrealistic)

3) A bubble can be popped/removed by clicking on it with the mouse
     - When a bubble is popped there should be a sound effect

4) Any other good ideas???
