Ok lets begin the super simple object detection. I will write most of the code and
I will try to explain all of it.

1) Review sum of differences and explain how this can be improved by using
   sum of squared differences

2) Discuss how images are loaded into Processing and how the pixels are managed.
   To be specific we need to discuss how the pixels are stored in memory

3) Now lets take a look at the data set. Notice that dimensions of the images.

4) Discuss how the sum of squared differences will work on the images.
   Specifically we need to mention the built in brightness function provided by processing

5) Write the code.

6) Test the code with the test images

7) Explain a new method using the Normalized Cross Correlation (dot product) and assigne for HW
