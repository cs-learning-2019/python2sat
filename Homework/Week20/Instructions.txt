The following is what you need to do for homework. You will need to write code to make a ball move
in cool ways.

Question 1:
Write a program in Processing that makes a ball move from the bottom left to the top right corner
of the screen in a wave. Hint: You should know how to make the ball move diagonally in a straight
line and you should also know how to make the ball move in a wave. So combine the two together.

Question 2:
Design a cool equation to make a ball move in a crazy way and program it. Hint: use https://www.desmos.com/calculator
to help you design a cool equation. 

Please remember to save your work. You will have to submit your code to me next class. Good Luck.
