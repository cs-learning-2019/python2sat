Answer the following questions. You may search up how to do things with datetime if you do
not know how to use it. So do not be afraid to use Google.

1) Write a function which prints out what the time would be 30min in the furture

2) Write a function that prints out a sad message if it is monday and a happy message if
it is Friday. In all other cases just print "Ok day"

3) Write code to determine how many frames a second Processing is running your project.
   Basically you need to determine how many times the draw section is called in a second.
   For your draw section please only draw one random rectangle and nothing else. Your setup
   section will just be the size(900, 900) command.
