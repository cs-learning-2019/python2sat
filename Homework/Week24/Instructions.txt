Please read over the hospital, person and virus example that we covered in class.
Make sure you fully understand this example.
Now I want you to add a few things to the code.

1) Add a new method into Hospital.py called add_money. This method will take one
number representing how much extra money to give to the hospital. The method will
add the extra money to the hospital's money attribute.

2) Add the __eq__ special method into Person.py which will allow you to compare
two people. Two people are the same if they have the same name, age and viruses.

3) Add the __len__ special method into Virus.py which will allow you to use the
len() command to find out how much the cure cost is. For example, if I do print(len(ebola))
then it should print 1000.

After you have made these three changes please copy and paste ALL of the code into a single
file. You will submit this single file to me so I can check your homework. The reason for
this is so that you do not need to submit three different files to me.
